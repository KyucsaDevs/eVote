## Project Overview

The **eVote System** is being developed to provide a secure, user-friendly, and scalable electronic voting platform. It aims to support elections in various contexts, ensuring transparency, privacy, and ease of use.

We welcome contributions that:
- Enhance security (e.g., authentication, encryption)
- Improve the user interface and user experience
- Add new features
- Fix bugs
- Improve performance or scalability

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before contributing, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) and Flask (if working on the backend)
- Frontend tools (e.g., html,css, Bootstrap5) if working on the frontend
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Fork the Repository
1. Fork the [eVote System repository](https://github.com/KyucsaDevs/eVote) to your GitHub account.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://https://github.com/KyucsaDevs/eVote.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd eVote
   ```

4. Set up the project dependencies:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
---

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter any bugs, security vulnerabilities, or want to request a feature:
1. Check if an issue already exists in the [Issues](https://github.com/KyucsaDevs/eVote/issues) section.
2. If not, create a new issue with:
   - A clear, descriptive title
   - Steps to reproduce the issue (if it's a bug)
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Relevant screenshots, logs, or error messages

---

## Branching Strategy

We follow the **Git Flow** branching model:
1. **`main`**: This branch contains the production-ready code.
2. **`develop`**: This branch contains the latest development code, and all new features should branch off from here.
3. **Feature branches** (`feature/your-feature-name`): Used for developing new features or fixing bugs.
4. **Bugfix branches** (`bugfix/issue-number`): Used to address specific bugs.

### Branch Naming Convention
- Use lowercase and hyphens to separate words.
- Examples:
  - `feature/user-authentication`
  - `bugfix/fix-issue-123`

---

## Coding Guidelines

Please follow these coding standards to maintain consistency:

### Backend (Python, Flask)
- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) for Python code.
- Use meaningful variable names and comments.
- For database models, ensure field validation and constraints are enforced at both the model and database level.

### General Guidelines
- Avoid code duplication and ensure your code is DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
- Break large functions or components into smaller, manageable ones.
- Write unit tests for new features or changes.

## Submitting a Pull Request

Once your changes are complete:
1. Push your changes to your branch:
   ```
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
   
2. Create a pull request (PR) on the repository's GitHub page.
3. Follow the PR template to provide:
   - A clear description of what the PR addresses
   - Screenshots or GIFs of the changes, if applicable
   - A list of issues fixed (if any)

Ensure that:
- Your PR is up-to-date with the `develop` branch.
- All tests pass locally.

---

## Code Review Process

Once you submit a pull request:
- A project maintainer will review your code.
- You may be asked to make changes based on feedback.
- When approved, the PR will be merged into the `develop` branch.
- If you are a maintainer, ensure to wait for at least one review from another team member before merging.

---

## Testing

Ensure that your code is fully tested. This includes:
- Unit tests for individual functions or components.
- Integration tests for ensuring components work together as expected.
- Running the full test suite before submitting a PR.

Use the following commands to run the project:
- **Backend (Flask)**: 
  ```
  python run.py
  ```

---

## Communication

For any questions or discussions:
- Use the projectâ€™s Slack channel for real-time communication.
- You can also reach out via the [Discussions](https://github.com/KyucsaDevs/eVote/discussions) section on GitHub for general topics.
